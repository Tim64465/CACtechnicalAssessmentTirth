Webpage description:

This is the QCAC-Prodct assessment. 
It is a simple, clear and mobile responsive product page with details about the product, the features and the reviews. 
I have chosen, Apple Vision Pro as my product.
This page has an image, a short description and the price, the code for that can be found under Hero.jsx.
Then it has the features listed, the code is under Features.jsx. 
Then below the features section, there is a review section, where user can add their reviews and see  all the past reviews. It shows the latest review on the very top of all the previous reviews and stores those reviews in local storage, code for the review form is in Form.jsx and code for the display section is in Reviews.jsx.

Technologies used:
It is built using 
React, 
Vite, 
JavaScript, 
has inline styling for component design using CSS, and local storage for saving the reviews. 

Installation details:
To run this application, user will need, 
Node.js, and npm.

Download the code as a zip file or clone the repo, 
then in the terminal go to the project directory folder, then install dependencies by typing 'npm install' on the terminal, once it is installed type 'npm run dev', this will give a localhost link in the terminal, by clicking on the link it should open the webpage. 

Challenges:
Learned new thing which was about how I can use the local storage for saving reviews. 
Also learned, sorting reviews and how to keep latest review on top of all reviews.
